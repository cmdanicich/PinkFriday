## Acquire and Analyze - Pink Friday 

### #Barbz

The Pink Friday Acquire and Analyze scrapes Twitter for the hashtag “#barbz,” which is related to the pop singer/rapper, Nicki Minaj. Once the data was pulled it was placed into a data frame using pandas and then into a .csv file for further analysis. The data was cleaned and descriptive statistics were taken to obtain the top_1000 tokens from the dataset. These words were then used to build a word cloud which concluded the analysis. The top words were “Pink Friday” or Nicki Minaj’s first, and top selling album.
