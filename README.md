## Acquire and Analyze - Pink Friday 

### #Barbz

The Pink Friday Acquire and Analyze scrapes Twitter for the hashtag “#barbz,” which is related to the pop singer/rapper, Nicki Minaj. Once the data was pulled it was placed into a data frame using pandas and then into a .csv file for further analysis. The data was cleaned and descriptive statistics were taken to obtain the top_1000 tokens from the dataset. These words were then used to build a word cloud which concluded the analysis. The top words were “Pink Friday” or Nicki Minaj’s first, and top selling album.

## Feedback

Consider this **complete** and thanks for expanding the data set. The analysis is a bit lightweight (basically one word cloud). I would have liked
to see some more techniques from class used, although it's not easy to imagine what you would have done on this data set. Having two (or more!) 
artists would have given you a much richer set of text to work with.
